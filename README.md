ioslidesexample
===============


Here's a
[worked example](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/sje30/ioslidesexample/blob/master/ioslidesexample.html)
of using Rmarkdown to generate ioslides.  You won't get to see the
notes window this way (as far as I can see), so for that you will need
to download the html first and then view it locally.
